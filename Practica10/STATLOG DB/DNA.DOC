1. TITLE:
	DNA Dataset (STATLOG version) - Primate splice-junction gene sequences (DNA)
        with associated imperfect domain theory

	PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
	Splice junctions are points on a DNA sequence at which `superfluous' DNA is
	removed during the process of protein creation in higher organisms.  The
	problem posed in this dataset is to recognize, given a sequence of DNA, the
	boundaries between exons (the parts of the DNA sequence retained after
	splicing) and introns (the parts of the DNA sequence that are spliced
	out). 

	PURPOSE
	This problem consists of two subtasks: recognizing exon/intron
	boundaries (referred to as EI sites), and recognizing intron/exon boundaries
	(IE sites). (In the biological community, IE borders are referred to
	a ``acceptors'' while EI borders are referred to as ``donors''.)

3. SOURCES and PAST USAGE
   3.1 SOURCES
   	(a) Creators: 
       		- all examples taken from Genbank 64.1 (ftp site: genbank.bio.net)
       		- categories "ei" and "ie" include every "split-gene" 
         	for primates in Genbank 64.1
       		- non-splice examples taken from sequences known not to include
         	a splicing site 
   	(b) Donor: G. Towell, M. Noordewier, and J. Shavlik,

	The StaLog dna dataset is a processed vesrion of the Irvine 
	database described below.  The main difference is that the 
	symbolic variables representing the nucleotides (only A,G,T,C) 
	were replaced by 3 binary indicator variables.  Thus the original 
	60 symbolic attributes were changed into 180 binary attributes.  
	The names of the examples were removed.  The examples with 
	ambiguities were removed (there was very few of them, 4).   
	The StatLog version of this dataset was produced by Ross King
	at Strathclyde University.   For original details see the Irvine 
	database documantation.

	The nucleotides A,C,G,T were given indicator values as follows

		A -> 1 0 0
    		C -> 0 1 0
    		G -> 0 0 1
    		T -> 0 0 0

	The class values are 
		ei -> 1
                ie -> 2
                n  -> 3

   	(b) attributes predicted: given a position in the middle of a window
       		60 DNA sequence elements (called "nucleotides" or "base-pairs"),
       		decide if this is a
		a) "intron -> exon" boundary (ie) [These are sometimes called "donors"]
		b) "exon -> intron" boundary (ei) [These are sometimes called "acceptors"]
		c) neither                      (n)
   	(c) Results of study indicated that machine learning techniques (neural
       		networks, nearest neighbor, contributors' KBANN system) performed as
       		well/better than classification based on canonical pattern matching
       		(method used in biological literature).

	HISTORY
	This dataset has been developed to help evaluate a "hybrid" learning
   	algorithm (KBANN) that uses examples to inductively refine preexisting
   	knowledge.  Using a "ten-fold cross-validation" methodology on 1000
   	examples randomly selected from the complete set of 3190, the following 
   	error rates were produced by various ML algorithms (all experiments
   	run at the Univ of Wisconsin, sometimes with local implementations
   	of published algorithms).
