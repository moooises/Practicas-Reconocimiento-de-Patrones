4. DATASET DESCRIPTION:

   The instances were drawn randomly from a database of 7 outdoor 
   images.  The images were handsegmented to create a classification
   for every pixel.  

   Each instance is a 3x3 region.

	4.1. Number of Instances:  2310

	4.2. Number of Attributes: 19 continuous attributes

	4.3 Number of Classes: 7
   		Classes: 
			1 = brickface	330 examples (14.29%) 
	    		2 = sky		330 examples (14.29%) 
	    		3 = foliage	330 examples (14.29%) 
	    		4 = cement	330 examples (14.29%) 
	    		5 = window	330 examples (14.29%) 
	    		6 = path	330 examples (14.29%) 
	    		7 = grass	330 examples (14.29%)

	4.4. Attribute Information:

    		1.  region-centroid-col:  the column of the center pixel of the region.
    		2.  region-centroid-row:  the row of the center pixel of the region.
    		3.  region-pixel-count:  the number of pixels in a region = 9.
    		4.  short-line-density-5:  the results of a line extractoin algorithm
		 that counts how many lines of length 5 (any orientation) with
         	 low contrast, less than or equal to 5, go through the region.
    		5.  short-line-density-2:  same as short-line-density-5 but counts 
		 lines of high contrast, greater than 5.
    		6.  vedge-mean:  measure the contrast of horizontally
   		 adjacent pixels in the region.  There are 6, the mean and 
         	 standard deviation are given.  This attribute is used as
        	 a vertical edge detector.
    		7.  vegde-sd:  (see 6)
    		8.  hedge-mean:  measures the contrast of vertically adjacent
          	 pixels. Used for horizontal line detection. 
    		9.  hedge-sd: (see 8).
    		10. intensity-mean:  the average over the region of (R + G + B)/3
    		11. rawred-mean: the average over the region of the R value.
    		12. rawblue-mean: the average over the region of the B value.
    		13. rawgreen-mean: the average over the region of the G value.
    		14. exred-mean: measure the excess red:  (2R - (G + B))
    		15. exblue-mean: measure the excess blue:  (2B - (G + R))
    		16. exgreen-mean: measure the excess green:  (2G - (R + B))
    		17. value-mean:  3-d nonlinear transformation
         	    of RGB. (Algorithm can be found in Foley and VanDam, Fundamentals
         	    of Interactive Computer Graphics)
    		18. saturation-mean:  (see 17)
    		19. hue-mean:  (see 17)


		Missing Attribute Values: None


NOTE
        EIGHT ATTRIBUTES ARE LINEAR COMBINATIONS (OR ARE CONSTANT), AND ARE
        BETTER REMOVED FOR THE PURPOSES OF LINEAR, QUADRATIC OR SIMILAR ALGORITHMS.
                     (NAMELY attributes X3, X10-X16).
